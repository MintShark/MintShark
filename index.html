        <h1 class="center">Hello!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! I am from Oxford, Nova Scotia, the blueberry capital of Canada. I have a BSc in
            Physics from StFX, and during my time in Antigonish, ran on the StFX varsity cross country running team.
            We attended meets as far away as London, Ontario, and won the AUS banner every year we competed
            (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014). During my time so far at the NSCC Institute of Technology, I've learned a number
            of programming languages including PHP, C#, C++, Java, Client-side Scripting
            (Javascript, jQuery, ECMAscript, React, some node/npm), Python, and much more. For work experience, I
            spent a lot of time writing forms in Drupal 8, which was used to access and create resources within a
            company.
        </p>
        <p>On this site you will find a list of example projects below, as well as links to my

        <h1 class="left">Example Projects</h1>
        <p>Sorted by language, I've added some examples from a few different languages highlighting solutions to
            particularly memorable problems when coding applications. These are just a few of the applications I've
            built.
        </p>
        <ul class="nobullet">
            <li>
                <h3>PHP</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul class="nobullet spaced">
                    <li>I have industry experience with Drupal 8, building a site from scratch with built-in tools,
                        modules from drupal.org, as well as writing a module of my own. This module was a 40-element,
                        6 page form where each submission needed to be a new node of content on the Drupal site,
                        which was something the Webform module from drupal.org did not solve out of the box. Here is a
                        screenshot of the form.</li>
                    <li>
                        <img alt="screenie" src="/img/screenie.png" width="600px" height="400">
                    </li>
                    <li>The toughest part of building this form was passing datetime data to the database out of the
                        $form_state variable within the forms api, a feature of Drupal 8. Using ksm() from the devel
                        kint module, downloaded from drupal.org, made debugging and building the application much
                        easier than simple trial and error.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Client-side Scripting</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul class="nobullet spaced">
                    <li>I found the client-side scripting course at NSCC IT to be one of the most useful. We started
                        out doing simple javascript, followed by writing jQuery and React in some applications. We
                        also got exposed to some ECMAscript code and using npm on the command line. The most memorable
                        app I remember building was the maze game. It had a few minor challenges, erasing and drawing
                        shapes to the screen to move the character around to try to collect the diamond.</li>

                <h3>Java</h3>

            <li>
                <ul class="nobullet spaced">
                    <li>With Java I built a number of cool apps, I am proud of at least 3 apps I've written to date in
                        Java. This would be a screensaver app, a calculator app, and a quiz app. The calculator and
                        quiz were done in Android with XML and Java, while the screensaver was done in Eclipse. Here
                        is a snapshot of all 3 apps running.</li>

                <h3>C#</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul class="nobullet spaced">
                    <li>At NSCC, I took two different C# courses, PROG 2200 Advanced OOP and PROG 2500 Windows
                        Programming. Programming in Windows is great because it allows to build applications you know
                        so many people will use and enjoy, given Windows is such a commonly used operating system. I
                        have two projects to show off that took a bit of time to write, one called LocalNote, an app
                        to create, save, edit, and delete notes which stores data with SQLite, so your data is
                        persisted after you close. I also have a media player app, which allows a user to index music
                        on the machine, and store and play it within the app with play, pause, and stop commands.</li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>C++</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul class="nobullet spaced">
                    <li>During my time in C++, we mostly built applications for the command line, which included a
                        tic-tac-toe game, file IO, and a rational number calculator, just to name a few. At the end of
                        the C++ course, we did an awesome visual game called 'Humans vs. Zombies'. This was a predator
                        prey simulation with specific rules where the zombies try to eat the humans, but both
                        populations multiply under certain rules. One of the objectives of the simulation was
                        to get both humans and zombies to survive until at least the 1000th day. This was done
                        essentially by playing with numbers until everything levels out, but the simulation brought
                        together many C++ standard practices such as cyclical dependencies, pointers, garbage
                        collection with destructors, and many more concepts.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Capstone</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ul class="nobullet spaced">
                    <li>For capstone, I was part of a team of 4 tasked with creating a virtual tour of our school. This
                        was a challenging task, and took a lot of time and patience, but we came up with an awesome
                        app that worked well and impressed many at the Capstone Expo. The site was live as of April
                        15th, 2019, and may still be running. Visit
                        <a href="http://www.nscc360.site">http://www.nscc360.site</a> and check it out. If it is
                        no longer running, I have provided some screenshots below. You can move around the school in
                        panoramic visuals with the buttons on the panos, or a built-in map feature, which acts as a
                        birds eye view of the school and a 'cheat sheet' for getting around. This was done with React
                        and Docker, so it is very recent and cutting-edge.</li>
